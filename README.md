# Stack
This is a simple stack implementation in python using a list.

Basic operations of stack:

    Push — Inserts an element at the top

    Pop — Returns the top element after removing it from the stack

    isEmpty — Returns true if the stack is empty

    Peek — Returns the top element without removing it from the stack

    showItems — prints all the items in the stack
